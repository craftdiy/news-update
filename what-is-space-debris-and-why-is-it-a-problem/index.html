Micrometeoroids and orbital debris (mmod) is the number one risk for nasa’s human spaceflight programs. Because debris flying in low earth orbit (closer to earth) has a speed of around 11,000km/h, it makes even small objects incredibly dangerous. Much of the debris is in low earth orbit, within 2,000 km (1,200 miles) of earth’s surface, though some debris can be found in geostationary orbit 35,786 km (22,236 miles). Dennis wong low earth orbit (leo) is becoming increasingly cluttered after 60 years of continuous rocket and satellite launches.
