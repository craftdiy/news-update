<p>When deciding to building design, one of the most crucial aspects that the designers and engineers have to make provision for is the safety aspect. The primary objective of structural analysis and design is to produce a structure capable of resisting all applied loads without failure during its intended life. Detailing, drawing and preparation of schedules. This will result in more grounded design decitions, less conflicts between disciplines and a better understanding of the project as a whole.

<p>In this article named âprocedure of structural designâ, the steps involved in the design process are described. Structural designers can use a variety of methods to design durable structures. Knowing the design codes and design criteria that we will use at the start of our task is a must in structural design. Structural engineers may use some creativity to design a structure with visual appeal, but they must also ensure that the structure is safe and stable for its intended use.

<p>A building should be able to withstand natural calamities like heavy winds. When deciding to building design, one of the most crucial aspects that the designers and engineers have to make provision for is the safety aspect. Of structural members to withstand the internal forces calculated from the structural analysis. This includes buildings, but the term structure can also be used to refer to any body of connected parts that is designed to bear.
