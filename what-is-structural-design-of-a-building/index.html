<p>When deciding to building design, one of the most crucial aspects that the designers and engineers have to make provision for is the safety aspect. The primary objective of structural analysis and design is to produce a structure capable of resisting all applied loads without failure during its intended life. Detailing, drawing and preparation of schedules. This will result in more grounded design decitions, less conflicts between disciplines and a better understanding of the project as a whole.

<p>In this article named “procedure of structural design”, the steps involved in the design process are described. Structural designers can use a variety of methods to design durable structures. Knowing the design codes and design criteria that we will use at the start of our task is a must in structural design. Structural engineers may use some creativity to design a structure with visual appeal, but they must also ensure that the structure is safe and stable for its intended use.

<p>Even though a lot of advancements happened in the construction industry, there aren’t many changes with respect to cement.when it comes to concrete, which is the most consumed material in the world after water, we can find some effective researches. The planning phase will consider the various factors that affect the layout and the dimension of the structure. It is a method or tool by which we find out safe and economical specifications of a structure or a member of the structure sufficient to carry the load.
