Quick, easy artisan bread Purple House Café From purplehousecafe.com
A type of rye bread, flavorful pumpernickel hails from germany, where it’s made with coarsely ground whole rye berries. The traditional version requires a lot of patience to create, since the recipe calls for baking pumpernickel at a low temperature for as long as 24 hours. These include such ingredients as natural butyl butyrl lactate and natural dairy complex. Artisan bread can take longer to make than regular bread simply because the fermentation process, which should last for up to 24 hours, is recognized when making this type of bread.
