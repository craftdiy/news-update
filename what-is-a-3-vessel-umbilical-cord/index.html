<p>Single artery umbilical cord problems only happen in around 1% of pregnancies, although the risk increases to 5% for twin pregnancies. The cord normally contains two arteries (the umbilical arteries) and one vein (the umbilical vein), buried within a thin walled tube with jelly as support. The umbilical cord is a bundle of blood vessels contained within a tubular sheath of amnion and consists of two paired umbilical arteries and one umbilical. However, some babies have just one artery and vein. Color Doppler image correctly demonstrating a threevessel umbilical.</p>
