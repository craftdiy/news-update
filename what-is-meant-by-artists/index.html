When we say ‘african art’, what do we actually mean? In his work, cézanne was not just presenting us with, say, a landscape, or a picture of his father.</p>
<h3 id="the-three-classical-branches-of-visual-art">The Three Classical Branches Of Visual Art.</h3><p>I have a traditional view and prefer artwork that speaks for the artist or period.
