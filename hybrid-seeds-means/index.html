This means that farmers and gardeners are not specifically choosing certain plants to cross pollinate to breed for certain characteristics. Hybrid vegetable seeds are created by artificially crossing two or more varieties of a certain plant. Hybridization is most often done to improve, or reduce certain characteristics. However, hybrid seeds, though they can be saved, often the offspring may not produce the same type of fruit.

<p>A good example of hybrid seeds are tomato plants that are resistant to late blight (which also caused the irish potato famine in the 1800’s). Hybrid seeds are scientifically produced, either to sell to consumers or to grow commercial crops. In a garden catalog, hybrid seeds are often named as f1 seeds. This means you can save open pollinated seeds, adapt them for your area over many growing seasons, and enjoy caring for the plants through their entire life cycle as they produce for you from generation to generation.</p>

<p>Saving seeds is a possibility for the following year. Hybrid seeds hybrids are five times as expensive as conventional products since they take longer to develop and are more complicated. Hybrid seeds are specifically bred for improved characteristics, such as higher yield, disease resistance, flavor, or color. The term “hybrid,” which you’ll often see in seed catalogs, refers to a plant variety developed through a specific, controlled cross of two parent plants.

<p>Plant breeders cross varieties and record their results over and over until a formula emerges that produces consistently excellent results. This means the pollen from one variety of plants has been transferred to a different variety of plants in the same species. The red savina, for example, is a red habanero that is developed to produce larger, hotter and heavier fruit. But, if you grow an f1 hybrid seed and you like it, you must go back to the source you got it from if you wish to grow it out. OpenPollinated vs. Hybrid vs. Heirloom Seeds What Do They Mean.</p>

As such, the hybridization often focuses on pest or disease resistance, color, size, and how well the harvested crop responds to transporting.
