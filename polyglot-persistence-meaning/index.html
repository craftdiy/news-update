Polyglot Persistence From slideshare.net
Polyglot persistence means using data storage technology based on the way data is being used by individual applications or components of a single application. Polyglot persistence it is the term that used to describe different data storage technologies to handle multiple data stores at a same time. The official definition of polyglot is “someone who speaks or writes several languages.”. This won&#39;t be a fast revolution, but i do believe the next decade will see the database thaw.

So called source represents the place where the reference data is stored. Of course, to avoid discrepancies in these different storage places, one place can be designated as a source of truth.

<p>What all of this means is that if you're working in the enterprise application world, now is the time to start familiarizing yourself with alternative data storage options. The conventional understanding is that to achieve polyglot persistence you store each discrete data type in its own discrete technology. As you can correctly deduce, the polyglot here means that the data is duplicated among different data stores. When your application adopts polyglot persistence it doesn't have to be bound to a single data store. SAP Commerce Cloud Persistence Mechanisms.</p>
