<p>The great thing about ceramic tiles is that you now have more options with advances in technology. Porcelain ceramics are made by heating materials, generally kaolin clay, in a kiln to temperatures between 2,200 and 2,600 degrees fahrenheit. The properties of ceramic materials also vary greatly due to differences in bonding, and thus found a wide range of engineering applications. Ferroelectric ceramics (barium titanate batio3) have a high dielectric constant and can be used to make capacitors. Large Pueblo Style Pottery Pot (Circa Early 1900’s), Curiosity 6, 88.</p>
