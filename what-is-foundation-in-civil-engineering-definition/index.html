What is pile foundation? What are the Uses of different types of Piles From iamcivilengineer.com
In doing this, much use may be made of soil mechanics but to a large extent foundation engineering still remains an art. In this chapter broad guidelines for fixing the dimensions of foundation are given and different types of foundations are explained. The foundation should be stiff and rigid to avoid possibilities of tilt in it. The following are the main types of foundations :

<p>The foundation plays a crucial role in the structure and it is the lowermost part of the building below the ground level which provides a base for the structure.; The bottom most part of the substructure which transmit load of the structure along with its own weight into the soil underneath or surroundings. In doing this, much use may be made of soil mechanics but to a large extent foundation engineering still remains an art. Purpose of foundation in construction.

<h3 id="the-width-of-the-wall-is-constructed-thicker-at-the-base-in-a-stepped-fashion">The Width Of The Wall Is ConÂ­structed Thicker At The Base In A Stepped Fashion.</h3><p>These types of foundation are used when the soil close to the ground surface has sufficient bearing capacity and underlying weaker strata do not result in undue settlement. In doing this, much use may be made of soil mechanics but to a large extent foundation engineering still remains an art. The bottom most part of the substructure which transmit load of the structure along with its own weight into the soil underneath or surroundings. In the language of civil engineers, the term âfoundationâ denotes, âstructure at founding levelâ.</p>
<h3 id="foundations-foundations-in-black-cotton-soil">Foundations Foundations In Black Cotton Soil.</h3><p>The term foundation originates from the latin fundatio, from the verb fundare, to found, to set, to place. It is at the periphery of civil, structural and geotechnical engineering disciplines and has distinct focus. Foundation engineering can be realized as an âartisticâ approach rather than a routine. One of the main purposes of the foundation is to distribute loads of the superstructure to a large area of soil so that the load intensity at the base is reduced.</p>
<h3 id="the-load-intensity-is-so-reduced-that-it-is-brought-under-the-safe-bearing-capacity-of-the-soil">The Load Intensity Is So Reduced That It Is Brought Under The Safe Bearing Capacity Of The Soil.</h3><p>A box caisson is normally built at land, then launched, floated to place, and sunk into a previously prepared foundation, leaving the upper edge above. Without carrying shear failure or bearing capacity failure and excessive settlement. What is shallow foundation in civil engineering? Every structure has two component parts.</p>
<h3 id="the-basic-function-of-a-foundation-is-to-transfer-the-dead-loads-live-load-and-other-loads-to-the-subsoil">The Basic Function Of A Foundation Is To Transfer The Dead Loads, Live Load, And Other Loads To The Subsoil.</h3><p>Generally, when the edge of the footing cannot be extended beyond the property line, the exterior footing is connected by a strap beam with interior footing. The total load of the structure transmitted to the base of the structure is spread over a large area by a spread foundation. The foundation plays a crucial role in the structure and it is the lowermost part of the building below the ground level which provides a base for the structure.; Foundation stability is also an essential requirement of a good foundation.</p>
