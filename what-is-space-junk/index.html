These are collectively known as space junk. Discarded satellites make up a lot of the space junk around earth, as well as debris from aerospace vehicles discarded during their descent. Some pieces of junk are as small as paint flecks or shards of metal, with diameters of less than half an inch. Experts have reassured that the collision will not have a large impact on the moon and is, in and of itself, quite unremarkable.
