<p>As buddhists and hindus believe that the head is the best part of the body and the feet are the worst, nepalis never touch somebody with their feet. Mula is a nepali name for radish but when used for humans, its meaning gets too offensive names since people cannot be called worthless for no reason. They tell how much, how often, when and where something is done. The feet are the most unclean part, so don’t put yours on chairs or tables, and when sitting, try not to point the soles of your feet at anyone.
