9 Interesting Facts to Know About Aircraft Composite Materials From keyshone.com
Here are some of the most commonly used metals for aerospace systems. The metals used in the aircraft manufacturing industry include steel, aluminium, titanium and their alloys. Furthermore steel aircraft are rare but indeed possible. Junkers’ work was noticed by henry ford, who borrowed heavily from it (too heavily, said junkers, and sued him) to make the ford trimotor in 1925.
