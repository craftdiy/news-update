It looked like fun, but when i clicked the link it took me straight to the sign up page without really telling me what it was. Craftsy ranks 14th among do it yourself sites. The battery life is ok not great, and luckily i don’t really take it out on the go much. Since i’ve been getting back into crocheting after a long hiatus, i’ve been starting to get ads for something called craftsy.
