Structural Engineering GEM Enterprise From gem-enterprise.com
A factor of safety less than one means the structural element will fail at less than the design load, which is unacceptable. Structural engineers are responsible for designing structures that can withstand pressure and force. Structural engineering design ensures the structures are safe, stable, and don’t collapse under applied loads. Structural engineers ensure that the buildings, bridges, houses, skyscrapers, and all kinds of structures are safe and stable without the possibility of collapsing.
