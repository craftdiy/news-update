What Software Engineers Mean When They Say… by Tia Gao Medium From medium.com
In addition to building their own systems, software engineers also test, improve, and maintain software built by other engineers. According to the institute of electrical and electronics engineers (ieee), software engineering means applying the principles of engineering to the software development field. They coordinate each department&#39;s needs, suggest technical direction, and set up any networks that link up computers with the company. This can range from doing code reviews to bouncing possible solutions to a problem.
