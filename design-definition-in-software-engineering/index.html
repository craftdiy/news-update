<p>Software design is a mechanism to transform user requirements into some suitable form, which helps the programmer in software coding and implementation. The definition of âa good software designâ can vary depending on the application being designed. A software engineer is a person who applies the principles of software engineering to design, develop, maintain, test, and evaluate computer software.the term programmer is sometimes used as a synonym, but may also lack connotations of engineering education or skills. A software design document (also known as a software design specification or technical specification documents) is a written report of a software productâs design, describing its overall architecture.
