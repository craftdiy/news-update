<p>Software design is a mechanism to transform user requirements into some suitable form, which helps the programmer in software coding and implementation. The definition of “a good software design” can vary depending on the application being designed. A software engineer is a person who applies the principles of software engineering to design, develop, maintain, test, and evaluate computer software.the term programmer is sometimes used as a synonym, but may also lack connotations of engineering education or skills. A software design document (also known as a software design specification or technical specification documents) is a written report of a software product’s design, describing its overall architecture.
