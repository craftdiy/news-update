Nosql Polyglot Persistence - Sciencedirect From sciencedirect.com
• polyglot persistence refers to using a many different data storage and management technologies within an organization instead of using a single storage technology. It stores the data in the store adapted to the query pattern (access per key, per not exact pattern) and data type (hight/low value, high/low volume). • the data is stored using the method that is best suited for it. It was popularized with the development of nosql solutions and can be categorized as a pragmatic way to thinking about the data organization.

<p>So a rdbms data store, with index keys and neatly laid out data with relationships that can be easily queries has become the industry standard. Polyglot persistence, i.e., using different databases as appropriate for the different components within a single system, is becoming prevalent in. The rise of polyglot persistence requires cios and im leaders to evaluate new approaches to data consistency across. This will help in choosing that one.
