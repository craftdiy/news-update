The organisms used are typically microorganisms, particularly bacteria, algae, and fungi, such as yeasts and molds, but industrial fermentation may also involve cell cultures from plants and animals, such as cho cells and insect cells. Food fermentation is the conversion of sugars and other carbohydrates into alcohol or preservative organic acids and carbon dioxide.all three products have found human uses.

<p>Batch fermentation means that each time a batch of penicillin or a similar medicine is made, they start fresh with a new batch. It is an attractive renewable resource because it originates from feedstocks including grains and crops such as corn, sugar cane, sugar beets and cassava. Reaction conditions are mild, in aqueous media and most reaction steps occur in one vessel. The fermentation process is a deciding factor in producing biofuels like ethanol.</p>

<p>The production of alcohol is made use of when fruit juices are converted to wine, when grains are made into beer, and when foods rich in starch, such as potatoes, are fermented and then. Fermentation plays a big role in the meat industry as it is used during the process of creating cured sausages such as salami. Fungi such as yeast help in the commercial production of beer, wine and other alcoholic drinks by fermenting fruit juices, malted grains or molasses. Lactic acid fermentation is used for making yoghurt and other fermented dairy products, fermented meat products such as certain types of sausages and vegetables, i.e. Ethanol Production Biotechnology The Biology Notes.</p>

<p>Industrial fermentation is a chemical engineering term used to describe the processes that utilize a chemical change induced by a living organism or enzyme, in particular bacteria, yeasts, molds, or fungi, that produces a specific product [1 ]. The cell mass and other major by products are highly nutritious and can be used in animal feeds. Thus, effective monitoring of the fermentation process is imperative to develop, optimize, and maintain biological reactors at maximum efficacy. Fermentation can sound complicated, but it doesn’t have to be. Recent advances in microbial fermentation for dairy&hellip; F1000Research.</p>
