Proper Course If I Had A Boat From propercourse.blogspot.com
Sometimes i can&#39;t move my feet it seems as if i&#39;m stuck in the ground somehow like a tree as if i can&#39;t even breathe and my screams come whispering out as if nobody can even see me like a ghost i can&#39;t see myself sometimes then again if i were a king if i had everything if i had you and i could give you your dreams if i were giant size on top of it all tell me what in the world would i. Kiss my ass i bought a boat i&#39;m going out to sea and if i had a boat i&#39;d go out on the ocean and if i had a pony i&#39;d ride him on my boat and we could all together go out on the ocean i said me upon my pony on my boat and if i were like lightning i wouldn&#39;t need no sneakers i&#39;d come and go wherever i would please and i&#39;d scare &#39;em by the shade tree Written about transformation and change, the first song is equal parts thoughtfully crafted words and inventive instrumental arrangements, serving as a foundation for the songs to come. If i had a boat i would sail it to the moon way up high i would float in a starry lagoon and my submarine would search in every sea for golden jellyfish who sting like honey bees if i had a plane i would soar into a dream i&#39;d steal lovely visions
