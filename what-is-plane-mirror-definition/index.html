<p>A mirror is defined as a reflecting surface and can be explained by the law of reflection, which states that when a ray of light is made to fall on the reflecting surface, the incident ray, the reflected ray and the normal to the surface of the mirror all lie in the same plane and the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection. The plane images created by plane mirrors are always virtual in nature. An image formed by the plane mirror is of the same magnification as that of the object. The plane images created by flat mirrors are erect/ upright and of equal size to the item. Reflection On A Plane Mirror Definition, Laws, Types, Characteristics.</p>
