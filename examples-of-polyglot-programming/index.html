Polyglot programming 1 is a website dedicated to exploring the benefits (and drawbacks) of combining multiple programming languages and multiple modularity paradigms in application development. In the same way that you might have a tiered system of components distributed across multiple nodes communicating using an rpc mechanism, you might also have components written in different languages.
