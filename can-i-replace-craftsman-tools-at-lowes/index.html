CRAFTSMAN 12Gallon Portable Wet/Dry Shop Vacuum in the Shop Vacuums From lowes.com
I broke a 25 year old screwdriver and took it to lowes for warranty and they insisted that i had to bring in the whole set the screwdriver came in before they would honor the warranty. I see their strategy as capturing the sales that craftsman already would have gotten while driving traffic to lowe’s instead of sears. You can search for craftsman tools in the “ mechanics tool sets ” department and the “ power tool combo kits ” section. Each tool carries a lifetime warranty.
