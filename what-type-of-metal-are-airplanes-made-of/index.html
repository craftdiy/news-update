When aircraft were made of fabric, they were hard to maintain since they deteriorated when left outside, due to the elements. Light alloys are used widely in aerospace, automotive. In 1919 to 1934 they began the construction of all metal planes with aluminum surfaces and others used a construction of metal monocoque. The mechanical structure of an aircraft is known as the airframe.
