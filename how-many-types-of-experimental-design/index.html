<p>Designing and interpreting controlled experiments are important inquiry skills addressed in many current science curricula. Consider your variables and how they are related. There are five key steps in designing an experiment: Randomized experimental designs provide the highest levels of causal validity. Types of Experimental Designs (3.3) YouTube.</p>
