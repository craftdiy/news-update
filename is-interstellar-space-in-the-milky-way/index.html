<p>Such tenuous matter in the interstellar medium of the milky way system, in which the earth is located, accounts for about 5 percent of the galaxy’s total mass. Interstellar space is the physical space within a galaxy beyond the influence each star has upon the encompassed plasma. This space is also near absolute vacuum with matter being very diluted. Contained in the milky way are stars, clouds of dust and gas called nebulae, planets, and asteroids. The Milky Way Is on Course to Collide With Another Galaxy, Causing.</p>
