Food processing and preservation full From slideshare.net
Food preservation includes food process practices that control the expansion of microorganisms, like yeasts although some ways work by introducing a benign bacterium or fungi to the food, and slow the reaction of fats that causes rancidity. The key objectives of food preservation are to overcome inappropriate planning in. Food processing is the transformation of raw ingredients, by physical or chemical means, into food or food into other forms. Chemical reactions are at the heart of food chemistry and can be used to explain a lot of interesting phenomena in food.
