<p>In addition, the purpose of an airplane goes a long way in the manufacturers’ decision to use a particular type of metal, especially the metal used in the plane’s frame and body. Most airplanes today are made out of aluminum, a strong, yet lightweight metal. Other metals, such as steel and titanium, are sometimes used to build aircraft. Light alloys are used widely in aerospace, automotive. Sugarpost Gnome Be Gone Airplane Takes Flight Welded Metal Art Made in.</p>
