The pipes used to transport potable drinking water in a home plumbing system use different materials than those used for the pipes carrying drain water. Water quality can be compromised by the presence of infectious agents, toxic chemicals, and radiological hazards. 96% of the water on earth’s surface is salt water in the form of oceans. In this system, the area is divided into different zones.
