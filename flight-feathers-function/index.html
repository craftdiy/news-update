Primaries form the bottom of a folded wing. The contour feathers include the feathers involved in flight (remiges) and the tail (rectrices). Flight feathers are the long, stiff, asymmetrically shaped, but symmetrically paired feathers on the wings or tail of a bird; Bristle plumes are found around the mouth of insect consuming birds where they function as a funnel.
