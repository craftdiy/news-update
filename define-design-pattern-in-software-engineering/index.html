These design patterns are specifically concerned with communication between objects. Contrary to design patterns which are common ways to solve common problems which have been formalized. Our first principle, abstraction, is the process of hiding complex properties or characteristics. Singleton is a very obvious choice and probably occurs on every list of design patterns.
