Customer satisfaction means that at the end of a transaction a customer has no unresolved questions or complaints. Customer satisfaction can be defined as the customer’s feelings or attitudes towards a product, a firm or a service provided by a company. It doesn&#39;t matter if a customer simply buys the same product over and over again from you if they feel no connection to your brand.
