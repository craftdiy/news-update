<p>Valves in the veins normally transport blood from the feet to the heart as the veins are flattened when standing or walking. If your systolic and diastolic readings fall into two different categories, your correct blood pressure category is the higher category. In this case, the clot blocks the regular flow of blood, increasing the pressure inside the veins and this, in turn, stresses and eventually damages the vein valves. Venous sampling is a diagnostic procedure that uses imaging guidance to insert a catheter into a specific vein and remove blood samples for laboratory analysis.abnormal levels of certain substances in the blood may indicate the presence of disease in the organ or tissue that produces them.
