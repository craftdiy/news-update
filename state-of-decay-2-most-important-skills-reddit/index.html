<p>Some of the quirk skills in state of decay 2 are pure comedy. Gardening, chemistry, mechanic, and just get soundproofing later. So, no more pesky and risky refuels. The third can depend on how you are going to build. .</p>
<h3 id="julia-on-the-other-hand-is-really-bad-at-defending-herself-but-is-a-great-chemist">Julia, On The Other Hand, Is Really Bad At Defending Herself, But Is A Great Chemist.</h3><p>Medicine is a must have.

Driving is nice, especially early but is only used at most 1/3rdish of the time and starts to have diminishing value as you add new survivors into rotation. Fishing was huge for me as it freed up making farms in the beginning few forts. For state of decay 2:</p>

However, that will likely take several weeks because these are very rare traits and the rare skills trader is also very rare and might not always have one even if he does show up thrice. Karly and julia are a couple who constantly bicker and fight. Farting around gives you a +10 morale boost.</p>
