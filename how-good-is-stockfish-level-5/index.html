First Test Stockfish 20042917, 2020.05.03 2020.05.04 From chessengines.blogspot.com
Most such tournament players can defeat those without this experience (or equivalent) easily: Level 3 is approximately 1400, so about the level of a fairly new tournament player taking chess a little bit seriously. Against stockfish 5, all i have to do is play an active but sound opening and wait for the obvious mistake to inevitably happen, while being extra careful not to make some myself. Skill 7, depth 5, 300ms.

<p>Iirc you can say âpractice with computerâ on the analysis board and then set the stockfish to a certain level using that. Level 5 is for intermediate players, but it's weaker than level 4 in some ways. Given enough time, it will purposefully mess up even easy dead.

<p>Against human, i play super aggressively. Playign the ai at low levels will teach you to wait for the inevitable ai blunder of an night/bishop, which is a bad habit, and at high levels it's just stressful. Basically level 3, but it attacks a little more, and defends slightly better. From what i understand, stockfish calculates a few of the top moves, and then can randomly choose at lower levels.

<p>I think that's because when stockfish is weaken, he weaken his positional game and his tactic game, so he can see better positional move, but like his tactics are weakened too, he can blunder some pieces. In the mid 1990âs i played a lot against a kasparov program that rated me at 2600, not that far from the worldâs top 10 back then. My guess is much lower. Level 3 and 4 are for beginner players.

<p>From what i understand, stockfish calculates a few of the top moves, and then can randomly choose at lower levels. Level 3 is approximately 1400, so about the level of a fairly new tournament player taking chess a little bit seriously. That is people who just know how to move the pieces and play against similar opponents. If there are many good moves, delta will be small, so each move receives a smaller score push.

<p>They would have to play a good number of games. Level 3 and 4 are for beginner players. I think i maybe know the problem, and that's true that i'm only 1900 and i beat stockfish level 5 on 90% of my games against it. Anyway don't play stockfish at your level other then practice not hanging pieces. Stockfish level 5 really stepping it up. AnarchyChess.</p>
