Non Ferrous Metals Examples / What is a NonFerrous Metal? Metal From oda-dink.blogspot.com
Stainless steel is one of the most. Ferrous metals are prone to both rusting and oxidation because of their iron content. Copper tubing is highly resistant to corrosion, and this metal is prized in the plumbing industry. Suppose you have additional or spare pipes lying around in your construction sites.
