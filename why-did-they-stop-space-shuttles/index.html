Why Did NASA Stop Using Space Shuttle To Fly To The ISS? From howandwhys.com
After the construction of the iss was completed, it turned out that there were no more direct tasks to deliver heavy cargo into orbit for the shuttles, and driving them for the sole purpose of delivering people to the iss was unreasonably expensive. The retirement of the shuttle program allowed nasa to began the research and development for the international space station (iss). “this program failed in the end for reasons well beyond its capability,” mark adler, then a system engineer at nasa’s jet propulsion laboratory, wrote in 2015. An operational shuttle is just too heavy to put on display that way.
