<h3 id="it-measures-the-ships-volume-and-has-nothing-to-do-with-weight">It Measures The Ship’s Volume And Has Nothing To Do With Weight.</h3><p>Gross register tonnage (grt) and net register tonnage (nrt) have been replaced by gross tonnage (gt) and net tonnage (nt) which express the size and volume of a ship as a simple dimensionless figure. Gross tonnage is different from gross register tonnage. N1+n 2 = total number of passengers the ship is permitted to carry. And nt is not to be taken as less than 0.30 gt.</p>
<h3 id="3-meanings-of-grt-abbreviation-related-to-vessel">3 Meanings Of Grt Abbreviation Related To Vessel:</h3><p>Gross tonnage is calculated by measuring a ship's volume (from keel to funnel, to the outside of the hull framing) and applying a mathematical formula. In modern maritime usage, “tonnage” specifically refers to a calculation of the volume or. The factor is not taken to be greater than unity. Low draft to depth (d/d) ratios will have low net tonnages.</p>
