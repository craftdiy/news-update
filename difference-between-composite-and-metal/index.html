<meta name="description" content="Incredible Difference Between Composite And Metal Ideas 2022, To put that into a perspective, while a cubic foot of cast steel weighs around 490 pounds, the same cubic foot of a composite material would be equivalent to 147 pounds. While the biggest difference between the two is obviously the lack of metal in composites, the composition of alloys and composites is also very different.
