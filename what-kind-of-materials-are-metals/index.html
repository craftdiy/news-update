<h3 id="less-carbon-means-cheaper-softer-and-easier-to-produce">Less Carbon Means Cheaper, Softer, And Easier To Produce.</h3><p>Steel is an iron alloy enriched with around 1% carbon and it is generally free of the impurities and residues that can otherwise be found in iron. Cast iron is actually the name of a mixture of multiple elements, including carbon, silicon, and iron. Metals are valued for their mechanical properties such as tensile strength, physical properties such as conductivity of electricity and chemical properties such as resistance to. Examples of metal alloys include stainless steel which is an alloy of iron, nickel, and chromium and gold jewelry which usually contains an alloy of gold and nickel.</p>
