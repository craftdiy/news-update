A software architecture is a fundamental part of a software system. While the software architecture identifies the components and elements that need to be included in the software, the software design focuses on how the software will be built. On the contrary, some applications may experience weaknesses due to a poorly designed architecture, not or more suited to the context. Software architecture typically refers to the bigger structures of a software system, and it deals with how multiple software processes cooperate to carry out their tasks.software design refers to the smaller structures and it deals with the internal design of a single software process.
