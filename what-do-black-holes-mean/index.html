Most black holes are the condensed remnants of a massive star, the collapsed core that remains. The event horizon of a black hole is the boundary around the mouth of. Earth will not fall into a black hole because no black hole is close enough to the solar system for earth to do that. All the mass in a black hole is concentrated in a tiny region, surrounded by a boundary called the “event horizon”.

<p>Black hole definition, a theoretical massive object, formed at the beginning of the universe or by the gravitational collapse of a star exploding as a supernova, whose gravitational field is so intense that no electromagnetic radiation can escape. How big are black holes? Here’s where things get crazy. A black hole’s “surface,” called its event horizon, defines the boundary where the velocity needed to escape exceeds the speed of light, which is the speed limit of the cosmos.

<p>Certainly, if black holes do lead to another part of a galaxy or another universe, there would need to. Black hole definition, a theoretical massive object, formed at the beginning of the universe or by the gravitational collapse of a star exploding as a supernova, whose gravitational field is so intense that no electromagnetic radiation can escape. Maybe a black hole leads to a white hole. When such a star has exhausted the internal thermonuclear fuels in its core at the end of its life, the core becomes unstable and gravitationally collapses inward upon itself, and the star’s outer layers are blown.

<p>Black holes are points in space that are so dense they create deep gravity sinks. The black hole's mass and size determine what kind it is. When such a star has exhausted the internal thermonuclear fuels in its core at the end of its life, the core becomes unstable and gravitationally collapses inward upon itself, and the star’s outer layers are blown. A black hole is surrounded by a membrane called an event horizon. The singularity of the black holes.</p>

<p>Black hole definition, a theoretical massive object, formed at the beginning of the universe or by the gravitational collapse of a star exploding as a supernova, whose gravitational field is so intense that no electromagnetic radiation can escape. The strong gravity occurs because matter has been pressed into a tiny space. With so much mass in a confined volume, the collective force of gravity overcomes the rule that usually keeps the building blocks of atoms from occupying the same space. What are black holes made of?

<p>Black holes form at the end of some stars’ lives. Because no light can escape, black holes are. It's generally accepted that stars with a mass at least three times greater than that of our sun's can undergo extreme gravitational collapse once their fuel depletes.
