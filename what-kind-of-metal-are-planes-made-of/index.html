Douglas DC2 KLM&#39;s First AllMetal Plane KLM Blog From blog.klm.com
Alloy steel combines multiple metals such as nickel, copper, and aluminum. About 70% of commercial civil aircraft airframes are made from aluminium alloys, and without aluminium civil aviation would not be economically viable. Aircraft can be constructed from wood, fabric, many types of metal, or even composite materials (e.g. Airplanes today are made mostly of aluminum.

<p>So metal began to be used for aircraft. About 70% of commercial civil aircraft airframes are made from aluminium alloys, and without aluminium civil aviation would not be economically viable. It is lightweight compared to other metals or steels, which is important for fuel efficiency and to allow an aircraft to carry more weight. Jet engines are made of steel, aluminum and titanium alloys. Vintage Metal Airplane Made to Look Antique.</p>

<p>The metal aluminum is the most popular material for constructing aircraft. Alloy steel combines multiple metals such as nickel, copper, and aluminum. This is why the landing gear is usually made of steel, which is robust, but heavy (which is why it is not used on other parts of the plane). Aluminum proved to have s uitable characteristics.

<p>Aluminum still remains as the most used metal in the aerospace application. There are four types of steel. However, titanium and steel are also used in their construction. Due to their high strength at relatively low density, aluminum and its alloys are still very popular raw materials for the manufacture of commercial aircraft.

<p>Low, medium, and high carbon steel are the three kinds, with low having approximately 0.30 percent carbon, medium 0.60 percent, and high 1.5 percent. The wheels are often made of very thick rubber to help absorb shock and decelerate the plane as it lands. Today, aircraft engineers value steel for its durability, hardness and resistance to high temperatures.
