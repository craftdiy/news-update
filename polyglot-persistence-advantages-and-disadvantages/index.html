<p>In data storage, the term persistence means that data survives after the process with which it was created has ended. Using aws as polyglot persistence solution has several advantages. Martin fowler first wrote about “polyglot persistence” in a blog post in 2011, and the term has caught on. While storing data, it is advisable to choose multiple data storage systems so that the system allows us to store various data in our future.

<p>Benefits attempting to make a single data store (or database if you prefer) encapsulate all your application contexts breeds… Polyglot persistence which takes a hybrid approach to persistence is getting a lot of traction these days. One of the main reasons why being a polyglot is an advantage is that being fluent in two or more languages opens up the door to a variety of jobs.
