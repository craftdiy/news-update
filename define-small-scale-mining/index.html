Small scale mining means the intentional mining of minerals in mechanised operations not exceeding twenty metres in depth or involving the sinking of shafts, drilling of adits, or other various underground openings; However, poverty is the main driver of these activities. The operations have transformed from artisanal to the use of sophisticated mining techniques in recent. Small scale industries work in a restricted area which makes them able to meet local and regional requirements.
