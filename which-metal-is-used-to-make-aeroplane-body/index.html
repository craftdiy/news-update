Today, aircraft engineers value steel for its durability, hardness and resistance to high temperatures. What materials are used to make an aeroplane? Several materials can be used for major structures—wings, fuselage, or landing gear, for example—on different types of aircraft. Other metals, such as steel and titanium, are used in specific components.
