<p>The word artesian comes from the town of artois in france, the old roman city of artesium, where the best known flowing artesian wells were drilled in the middle ages. Artesian well water means water from a well tapping an aquifer in which the water level will stand above the bottom of the confining bed of the aquifer, and in which the hydraulic pressure of the water in the aquifer is greater than the force of gravity. The artesian well connects to the confined aquifer. The difference is one is known as simply an âartesian wellâ and the other is known as a âflowing artesian.</p>
