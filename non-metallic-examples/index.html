Mica is used in electrical and electronics industry, limestone is highly used in cement industry. Metals, such as gold, silver, and copper, have the ability to reflect light from their surfaces and can be polished. These materials are able to retain their unique chemical properties during the machining process. Plastics are organic materials which can be moulded to shape under the action of heat or heat and pressure.
