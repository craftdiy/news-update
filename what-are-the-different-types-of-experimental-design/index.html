The types of experimental research design are determined by the way the researcher assigns subjects to different conditions and groups. It is clear that in this design, the difference between the subjectâ€™s positions on the dependent variable before and after the exposure to the independent variable (experimental factor) is taken as a measure of the effect of experimental variable.

<p>There are three types of experimentâ€¦ the first type is a laboratory experiment. Experimental research is a quantitative research method with a scientific approach, where a set of variables are kept constant while the other set of variables are being measured as the subject of an experiment. Determining which type of doe to use depends largely on: A true experiment is a type of experimental design and is used to establish cause and effect relationships. The research designs may be roughly categorized as â€˜Observationalâ€™ or.</p>
