Polyglot persistence however comes with severe disadvantages: The term polyglot is borrowed and redefined for big data as a set of applications that use several core database technologies, and this is the most likely outcome of your implementation planning. From the types of data you’re trying to store to your application architecture, polyglot persistence is a hybrid solution to data management.

<p>The polyglot data model is the master, and targets models are dependent on the polyglot model. There is no unique query interface or query language, and hence access to the database systems is not uni ed and requires knowledge of all needed database access methods.
