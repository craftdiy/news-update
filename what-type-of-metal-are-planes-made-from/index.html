<p>To manufacture reliable planes, engineers and others in the aviation industry use specific metals for engine parts and other components. Having a carbon content of 0.3% to 0.5%, this type of steel is highly suitable for machining connecting rods and light forgings with sufficient surface hardness. In this type metal blades usually rest on the hardwood. As far as the other plane parts are concerned, the engine’s piston is usually made out of steel whereas many other major parts are made of aluminum alloys.</p>
