At its most basic, sdx is the software abstraction of any it function — storage, networking or access — which in turn creates consistent, virtualized infrastructure that can be applied. The true meaning of software solutions. For a data center, it’s just as important to take the complicated processes of old and distill them down into simple actions. Software defined architecture (sda) provides a layer of virtualization between the software and its users, which connects users to a simple dashboard that masks the complex systems operating in the background.
