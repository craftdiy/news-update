Artesian well (overflowing well) a well that flows at the surface without pumping, because it is sunk into a confined aquifer whose hydraulic head (sometimes called the potentiometric or piezometric head) lies above ground level. Meanwhile, the flowing artesian well is a type of well that has been drilled into an aquifer. When the pressure from the ground water above becomes. Artesian wells are a special kind of well because these are wells that are dug into a confined aquifer.
