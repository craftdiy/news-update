A vector that has a magnitude of 1 is a unit vector. Vector algebra is a branch of mathematics where specific rules have been developed for performing various vector calculations. Vector calculation here means vector addition, vector subtraction, vector multiplication, and vector product. Vector graphics consist of mathematically defined lines, curves, and shapes, and they can be created and edited with vector editing apps like adobe illustrator and inkscape.
