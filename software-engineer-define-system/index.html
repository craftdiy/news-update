Typically, everyone on a software team has a job title and knows it. In startups, titles are often chosen quickly and without much careful. Software engineering is the systematic and disciplined approach to the design, development, testing, implementation, and maintenance of application software and computer systems software. The term programmer is sometimes used as a synonym, but may also lack connotations of engineering.
