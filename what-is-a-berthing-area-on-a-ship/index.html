The most common meaning of the word ‘berth’ is a pier or dock, which is the point where a ship ties up. Whether that spot is at a dock or an anchorage in or near the port, each ship is assigned a place to park in the harbor. Marzieh afkham, who is the country’s first foreign ministry spokeswoman, will head a mission in east asia, the state news agency reported. Docking is the mooring of a ship to a pier, quay or similar fixture, while berthing is the mooring of a ship within an allotted space at that pier, quay.

<p>Berthing area means a configuration of piles ( typically 4), positioned adjacent to a jetty, ramp or pontoon, designed for the permanent. A harbour is basically an area filled with water sheltered by natural barriers like land and rocks or artificial barriers like breakwaters sometimes surrounded by tetrapods, that can provide a ship with safe anchorage and allow the transfer of goods and/or passengers between the ship and the shore. F = (v 2 /18,000) x windage area, where f is the wind force in tonnes per square metre, v is the wind speed in m/s (metres/second) and windage area is the area of ship exposed to the wind in square metres. The berthing velocity of the vessel normal to the berth depends on the vessel size and type, frequency of arrival, possible constraints on movement approaching the berth, and wave, current and wind conditions likely to be encountered at berthing.</p>
