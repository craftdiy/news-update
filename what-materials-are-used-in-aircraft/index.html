Manufacturing methods utilized can be both conventional and. Ferrous metals are metals that contain iron as the chief material in the alloy. In the late 1920s and early 1930s, airplane manufacturers started producing more fuselages from aluminum and steel. For example, the demands of a commercial jet and a military fighter jet are completely different, resulting in various different requirements, which in turn result in.
