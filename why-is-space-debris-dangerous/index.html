<meta name="description" content="Free Why Is Space Debris Dangerous Ideas 2022, Most of it is floating around the planet, but some equipment was also left on the moon during the 60s and 70s. Space junk consists of the remains of satellites and other technology that was sent up into orbit, but has since stopped operation, and is now stuck up there.
Dangerous space junk has more than doubled over the past 25 years From pinterest.com
Solar panels of satellites are becoming larger and larger due to the increasing demand for energy, and the chance of such a panel being damaged by space debris is also increasing. In the case of most accidental collisions, this is mainly due to the fact that. We need to clean up the space around earth. Space junk is any human made stuff that has been left behind.
