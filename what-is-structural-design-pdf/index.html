Structural engineers need to make sure they design a load path that can safely transfer the load from its point of application through the structure all the way to the foundation where the structure meets the earth’s surface. U n i v e r s i t y o f. The basic objective in structural analysis and design is to produce a structure capable of resisting all applied loads without failure during its intended life. The primary purpose of a structure is to transmit or support loads.
