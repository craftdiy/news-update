Rubber, plastics, papers, feather, mica, etc. It is interesting that in electrical engineering in order to intentionally direct the electrons and magnetic field through required paths, one needs excellent magnetic materials which do not conduct electricity and also non magnetic material that. Platinum is not magnetic, but, depending on what other metals is aligned with, can be magnetic in jewelry. And their alloys like brass are not magnetic materials as their magnetic interactions are very weak.

<p>Magnets are attracted to some metals. There are distinct properties in the material, which are primarily pure metals or alloys without any iron. These are often made with annealed iron or steel, which simply means that they have been physically or chemically altered to reduce their hardness. They can’t be drawn into sheets as they are brittle and break on applying pressure. Nonferrous Metals List Science Struck.</p>

<p>Non magnetic metals include aluminium, copper, lead, tin, titanium and zinc, and alloys such as brass and bronze. Magnetic substances are substances that get attracted to magnets. Iron, nickel, and cobalt are the magnetic substances as objects made up of these materials are attracted by a magnet. These are often made with annealed iron or steel, which simply means that they have been physically or chemically altered to reduce their hardness. Nonferrous Metals List Science Struck.</p>

<p>Most other metals for example aluminium copper and gold are not magnetic. Two metals that aren’t magnetic are gold and silver. However, above a temperature called the néel temperature, some atoms break free of the alignment and the material becomes weakly magnetic. This does not make them ferrous alloys though.
