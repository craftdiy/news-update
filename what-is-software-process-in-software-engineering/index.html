Software engineering is the establishment and sound engineering principles applied to obtain reliable and efficient software product in an economical manner. This is the simplest software process, called the waterfall process. The term software specifies to the set of computer programs, procedures and associated documents (flowcharts, manuals, etc.) that describe the program and how they are to be used. And in this chapter we will focus on the first of the three.
