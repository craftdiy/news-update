Metals are typically malleable (they can be hammered into thin sheets) or ductile (can be drawn into wires). Metals have been used to make jewelry since ancient times. Not only does the material play a vital role in the engineering of the gear, but also the gear design as well. Steel has a wide range of applications in construction, machinery and weapons.
