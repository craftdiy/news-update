A system may be denned as an integrated set of components that accomplish a defined objective. A design system needs to be tailored to your specific needs, and hopefully, after looking at these types of visual. In short, distributed systems are collections of computers that collaborate to form one cohesive computer for the end user. System design is the process of defining the elements of a system such as the architecture, modules and components, the different interfaces of those components and the data that goes through that system.
