If you are travelling at 90% the speed of light relative to the interstellar gas and dust then you'll probably be ok.

<p>The theory of relativity says that neither matter nor information can travel faster than light. Alpha centauri is our closest star at about 3 light years, and the increasing expansion of the universe will only make this trek longer, until one day it becomes impossible to beat the spacial treadmill with light, let alone machines. But at slower speeds, it's still pretty far. Incredible and yet if we could travel at that speed. Time Travel Through Wormhole Is It Possible? Let's See.</p>

<h3 id="and-thats-what-makes-interstellar-travel-so-dang-hard">And That’s What Makes Interstellar Travel So Dang Hard.</h3><p>If you are travelling at 90% the speed of light relative to the interstellar gas and dust then you'll probably be ok. Why is space travel so hard? Impose much more than 1 g of acceleration onto a human for an extended period of time, and we will experience all kinds of health problems. Perhaps a few “museum humans” will choose to remain in their old form, but those beings will live on earth or space stations, too frail and ephemeral;</p>
<h3 id="incredible-and-yet-if-we-could-travel-at-that-speed">Incredible And Yet If We Could Travel At That Speed.</h3><p>My questions concern the problem. Alpha centauri is our closest star at about 3 light years, and the increasing expansion of the universe will only make this trek longer, until one day it becomes impossible to beat the spacial treadmill with light, let alone machines. Why is interstellar space travel nearly impossible? The fact that heat cannot dissipate in a vacuum makes thermal design for space systems particularly challenging compared to earth, where engineers can use air to move heat.</p>
