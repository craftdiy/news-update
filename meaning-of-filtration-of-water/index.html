<p>The act or process of filtering. As floc passes into the filter, the spaces between the filter grains become clogged, reducing this opening and increasing removal. Once the floc has settled to the bottom of the water supply, the clear water on top will pass through filters of varying compositions (sand, gravel, and charcoal) and pore sizes, in order to remove dissolved particles, such as dust, parasites, bacteria, viruses, and chemicals. Filtration is a process used to separate solids from liquids or gases using a filter medium that allows the fluid to pass through but not the solid.
