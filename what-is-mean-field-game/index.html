Mean field games, which models the the dynamics of large number of agents, has applications in many areas such as economics, finance, dynamics of crowds as well as in biology and and social sciences. This is achieved by exploiting the relationship between the finite and corresponding. Large number of players : This is achieved by exploiting the relationship between the finite and corresponding.
