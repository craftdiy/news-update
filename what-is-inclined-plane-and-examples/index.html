10 Inclined Planes Examples in Everyday Life StudiousGuy From studiousguy.com
Levers,inclined planes and pulleys are called simple machines Objects on inclined planes will often accelerate along the plane. A simple machine is a mechanical device that changes the direction or magnitude of a force.in general, they can be defined as the simplest mechanisms that use mechanical advantage (also called leverage) to multiply force. The analysis of such objects is reliant upon the resolution of the weight vector into components that are perpendicular and parallel to the plane.
