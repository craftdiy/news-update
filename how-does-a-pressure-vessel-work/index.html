However, note than an atmospheric storage tank is not a pressure vessel. The expansion vessel is a way to move water back and forth through the plumbing system as it expands and contracts, allowing the pipes to always remain full of water. If there are any issues that could lead to more serious problems, an inspector can point these out so the necessary maintenance is carried out.

<p>An inspector can periodically check to ensure that a pressure vessel is in good working order and does not pose a threat. Vessels, tanks, and pipelines that carry, store, or receive fluids are called pressure vessels. The normal (tensile) stress in the walls of the container is proportional to the pressure in the vessel and the radius of the vessel, and it is inversely related to the thickness of the. Cracked and damaged vessels can result in leakage or rupture failures. PRESSURE VESSELS.</p>
