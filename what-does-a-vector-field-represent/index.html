A vector field represents the region in a plane or space that contains a group of vectors that satisfy a function, $\textbf{f}(x, y)$ in $ \mathbb{r}^2$ or $\textbf{f}(x, y, z)$ in $\mathbb{r}^3$. We know that a vector is represented by an arrow which is placed over starting point that is immediately followed by the ending point of the vector. The surface is oriented by outward pointing normal. What do vector field singularities represent?

<p>In the second chapter we looked at the gradient vector. We know that a vector is represented by an arrow which is placed over starting point that is immediately followed by the ending point of the vector. Vector fields exhibit certain common shapes, which include a source (where the vectors emanate out of one point), a sink (where the vectors disappear into a hole, something.
