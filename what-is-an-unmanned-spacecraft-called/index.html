What is a unmanned spacecraft called? The word manned, though still used occasionally by the united states national aeronautics and space administration (nasa), is often replaced today in discussions of space travel by the word crewed, in recognition of the fact that women also.

<p>Not every uncrewed spacecraft is a robotic spacecraft; For example the space stations salyut 7 and mir, and the iss module zarya were capable of unmanned remote guided station keeping, and docking maneuvers with both resupply craft and new modules. The first spacecraft, the soviet unionâs sputnik 1, was launched on october 4, 1957; Spacecraft are used for a variety of purposes, including communications, earth observation, meteorology, navigation, space colonization, planetary exploration, and transportation of humans and cargo.</p>
