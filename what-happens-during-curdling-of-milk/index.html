Milk has sugarnamed lactose which is responsible for curdling when it transforms to lactic acid under the action of the enzyme &#39;lactase&#39; present in lactobacillus. 1) when the milk cools down from room temp, but still has some heat left in it. The result of this process of milk coagulation, or curdling, is a gelatinous material called curd. While curdled milk is safe to eat, it is not particularly appetizing.

<p>When milk is curdled, its sugar get oxidize to form lactic acid. Add a small amount of coffee to the almond milk, before then adding the rest gradually. When ph levels drop in milk, it turns acidic and milk protein (casein and others) molecules attract one another to form âcurdlesâ or lumps. It happens because the proteins in milk get denatured changed when heated.</p>

<p>The processes for making many other dairy products such as cottage cheese, ricotta, paneer and cream cheese start with milk curdling. Acidifying milk â essentially lowering its ph â causes the milk proteins, like casein, to unwind and unfold in a process known as protein denaturing. When milk is curdled, its sugar get oxidize to form lactic acid. Milk is heated to a designated temperature, and then an acid (lemon juice or vinegar) is added.

Milk has sugarnamed lactose which is responsible for curdling when it transforms to lactic acid under the action of the enzyme 'lactase' present in lactobacillus.

<p>Now, milk is composed of several compounds, primarily fat, protein, and sugar. As lemon is citric in nature and milk is acidic, when drops of lemons juice are added to the milk, it increases the acidic property of milk and the ph content of milk becomes low.
