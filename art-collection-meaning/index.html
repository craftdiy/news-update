Beautiful art collection of 99 Names of Allah (God) with Meaning From pinterest.com
A collection of an artist’s work is just that, a collection. In foreign countries the term “collection” is often the name or part of the name of a museum or museum complex. Art collecting has a long history, and most of the world’s art museums grew out of great private collections formed by royalty, the aristocracy, or the wealthy. A private collection is a privately owned collection of works (usually artworks) or valuable items.in a museum or art gallery context, the term signifies that a certain work is not owned by that institution, but is on loan from an individual or organization, either for temporary exhibition or for the long term.
